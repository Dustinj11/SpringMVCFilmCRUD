## Description

This program was designed to create, read, update and delete items within a database using Java Database Connectivity to modify or retrieve data from the database that contains fields that would be applicable to a Film Rental Store (think BlockBuster). What this project aimed to do was allow users to view any film they would like to see via the film ID or keyword, delete a film from the database, add a film to the database or modify a a film's fields. When you enter the website, you are shown a list of things you can do:

-Look up film by ID
-Look up film by keyword
-Add a Film

Once you click on "Look up film by ID" you are taken to a second page the requires you to enter an ID. Once you enter that ID, you will be shown all of the details of the film to include the cast of actors that are in that film and the categories that film belongs to (action, animation, children, classics, comedy, etc.). You will then be prompted to go back to the home page, edit a film or delete a film. If you select to go back to the home page, you will be sent back to the initial page with the initial prompts. If you select "Edit a Film," you will be given a display of fields that the film contains and it allows you to edit those fields. Once you finish editing the fields you wish to edit, you will be shown the corrected film information. If you select to "Delete a Film", the film will be deleted from the database and you will be shown a confirmation page that the film you have selected to delete has been deleted. You are able to perform this action repeatedly by navigating back to the home page to perform the initial actions again, if you would like.

### Lessons Learned

During this project, we collectively learned many things. We were able to collaborate, delegate and accomplish the overall tasks of the project. We were able to divide the tasks among ourselves and complete them individually. Whenever we were stuck on a specific task, we would collaborate together and perform pair programming in order to fix the problems that we were looking at. We learned quite a bit about how to collaborate on projects like this using GitHub and Zoom/Discord. This allowed us to upload, merge and download the updates that each of us individually committed to the code and program over all. The biggest lesson we learned was that we needed to be on the same page at the same time otherwise we run into merge conflicts and issues when we are trying to submit our own updates and then download our teammates updates. Another lesson we learned was that this project was far beyond our individual abilities and team abilities and we struggled to complete all of the user stories. This project was truly a team effort and in order to complete it, we required a ton of help from outside our group. Overall, the biggest thing we learned is that this field is truly a group effort and that teamwork is number one.  

### Technologies Used

The Technologies we used were Spring Tool Suite, Java, HTML, JSP's, Gradle Tool, the MAMP in order to incorporate our Apache server -- which we also used. Additionally, we used Atom text editor and MySql quite a bit. Using MySql, we were able to test each of our sql queries and commits throughout the project so that we were able confirm that each of the sql text's would work properly within the Java program. The incorporation of Spring into our Java programming allowed us to perform tasks much easier and more effectively.

### What was fun?

What was fun about this project was truly learning how to collaborate as a team, be efficient and effective as individuals and communicating together at all times letting each other know where we were at at each individual step. This allowed us to work together, while working separately on different pieces of the project. The other fun thing that we learned was how useful the Spring "magic" works and how easy this makes our projects now, and in the future. This project showed us how easily things can be done with the right tools, know-how and a little elbow grease. It was fun to be able to work together with each other in a group and really showed how these type of projects can be completed in a group setting and helped show us what the profession will be like when we get there. Overall, the most fun part about this project was finishing it and feeling accomplished as individuals and as a group.
